# Research Data Analysis

In this space, I share a collection of Python scripts and notebooks for scientific data processing, fitting, and analyzing. 

These scripts started as small utilities for my PhD work, helping to streamline the repetitive data analysis routine.  

They’re shared here to support reproducible, FAIR, and AI-ready research workflows.

These tools were developed as part of my research on "semiconductor thin films, spectroscopy, and surface analysis".  
Each script focuses on practical, reusable analysis — from classical models (e.g., attenuation models in X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy(XPS)) to general curve fitting, background subtraction, and data visualization.

- Examples
1). XPS analysis: baseline correction, peak fitting, and composition estimation  
2). Temperature-dependent data: curve fitting and activation energy extraction  
3). Spectral data tools: smoothing, normalization, and visualization utilities
4). ...

All you need is a recent version of Python and these packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`.
